We're always looking for ways to improve the site, if you have any suggestions let us know!

## Suggesting Changes

1. The easiest way to get ahold of us is to message one of us on ChiefDelphi. Reach out to <a href='https://www.chiefdelphi.com/u/Maximillian/summary' target='_blank'>Max</a> or anyone else on the [about page](/about).
2. File an Issue on our <a href='https://github.com/Max5254/onshape4frc.com/issues' target='_blank'>GitHub page</a>.

## Making the Change Yourself

This site is created using <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a>, but a basic knowledge of html or markdown is all that is required for most changes. Head over to our <a href='https://github.com/Max5254/onshape4frc.com' target='_blank'>GitHub page</a> and feel free to open a Pull Request! If you're interested in writing a blog post or other content but don't want to mess with the site yourself feel free to send us any content and we can work on the formatting and integration. Blogs are written using <a href='https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started' target='_blank'>Markdown</a>.
