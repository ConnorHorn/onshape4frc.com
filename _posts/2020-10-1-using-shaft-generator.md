The shaft generator featurescript does exactly what the name implies -  automatically generates any and all shaft types youâ€™ll need in FRC. Gone are the days of spending time repeatedly sketching boring hex shafts.

Simply launch the shaft generator and select the desired origin of the shaft. From here you have the option to select an end face or simply enter the length of the shaft. Select your preferred retention type and voila - you have yourself a generated shaft.

<div class="row justify-content-center pb-4">
    <div class="col-md-10 pr-10">
        <h5 class="text-center">Generated Hex Shaft</h5>

    </div>
</div>

This featurescript saves lots of time and saves you from some pretty uninteresting CAD work. Additionally, it reduces the amount of features in your feature tree, making it easier to both navigate and to modify.
